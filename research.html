    <h4>"Blind Image Deblurring using FFT-ReLU with Deep Learning Pipeline Integration"</h4>
        <p><i>AMA Radi, PS Majumder, SM Mahmud, MMH Noki, MH Ali, MM Khan arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.08344</i></p>
        <p>Blind image deblurring is the process of deriving a sharp image and a blur kernel from a blurred image. Blurry images are typically modeled as the convolution of a sharp image with a blur kernel, necessitating the estimation of the unknown blur kernel to perform blind image deblurring effectively. Existing approaches primarily focus on domain-specific features of images, such as salient edges, dark channels, and light streaks. These features serve as probabilistic priors to enhance the estimation of the blur kernel. For improved generality, we propose a novel prior (ReLU sparsity prior) that estimates blur kernel effectively across all distributions of images (natural, facial, text, low-light, saturated etc). Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency, with inference times up to three times faster, while maintaining high accuracy in PSNR, SSIM, and error ratio metrics. We also observe noticeable improvement in the performance of the state-of-the-art architectures (in terms of aforementioned metrics) in deep learning based approaches when our method is used as a post-processing unit.</p>

    <h4>"An end-to-end authentication mechanism for wireless body area networks"</h4>
        <p><i>M Jahan, FT Zohra, MK Parvez, U Kabir, AM Al Radi, S Kabir Smart Health 29, 100413</i></p>
        <p>Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) ensures high
quality healthcare services by endowing distant and continual
 monitoring of patients’ health conditions. The security and
 privacy of the sensitive health-related data transmitted through
 the WBAN should be preserved to maximize its benefits. In this
 regard, user authentication is one of the primary mechanisms
 to protect health data that verifies the identities of entities
 involved in the communication process. Since WBAN carries
 crucial health data, every entity engaged in the data transfer
 process must be authenticated. In literature, an end-to-end user
 authentication mechanism covering each communicating party
 is absent. Besides, most of the existing user authentication
 mechanisms are designed assuming that the patient’s mobile
 phone is trusted. In reality, a patient’s mobile phone can be stolen
 or comprised by malware and thus behaves maliciously. Our
 work addresses these drawbacks and proposes an end-to-end user
 authentication and session key agreement scheme between sensor
 nodes and medical experts in a scenario where the patient’s
 mobile phone is semi-trusted. We present a formal security
 analysis using BAN logic. Besides, we also provide an informal
 security analysis of the proposed scheme. Both studies indicate
 that our method is robust against well-known security attacks.
 In addition, our scheme achieves comparable computation and
 communication costs concerning the related existing works. The
 simulation shows that our method preserves satisfactory network
 performance.</p>
